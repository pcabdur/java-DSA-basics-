A **B-Tree** is a self-balancing tree data structure commonly used in databases and file systems. Unlike a binary tree (like AVL or BST), a B-Tree allows nodes to have multiple children, making it suitable for systems that read and write large blocks of data. It ensures that the tree remains balanced by dividing nodes efficiently.

### Key Properties of a B-Tree:
1. **Multi-child nodes**: Each node in a B-Tree can have more than two children. The number of children a node can have depends on a fixed degree `m`, where `m` is called the "order" of the tree.
   - A node can contain a minimum of `⌈m/2⌉ - 1` keys and a maximum of `m - 1` keys.
2. **Balanced**: The height of the tree is kept low even for large datasets, ensuring that searches, insertions, and deletions are efficient.
3. **Sorted**: Keys in a node are stored in a sorted order.

### Rules for B-Tree of order `m`:
1. Every node can contain at most `m - 1` keys.
2. Every internal node can have at most `m` children.
3. Every node except the root must have at least `⌈m/2⌉ - 1` keys.
4. The root can have as few as 1 key if it is not a leaf node.
5. All leaves are at the same level (the tree is height-balanced).

### Example of a B-Tree (order 3):
Let’s build a B-Tree of order 3 step by step by inserting the values: **10, 20, 5, 6, 12, 30, 7, 17**.

### Step-by-step Insertion:

#### **Step 1: Insert 10**
- The tree is empty, so `10` becomes the root node.

```
[ 10 ]
```

---

#### **Step 2: Insert 20**
- `20` is inserted into the same node as `10`. Since the node can hold up to `2 (m-1)` keys (order 3), the node becomes:
```
[ 10, 20 ]
```

---

#### **Step 3: Insert 5**
- Insert `5` into the same node. Now, the node contains `[5, 10, 20]` (sorted).

```
[ 5, 10, 20 ]
```

---

#### **Step 4: Insert 6**
- The node is now full. It contains `3` keys, and the maximum number allowed for a B-Tree of order 3 is `2`. So, the node is split into two nodes, and the middle key (`10`) moves up to become the new root.

**Before Split**:
```
[ 5, 6, 10, 20 ]
```

**After Split**:
- `10` becomes the root, and `5` and `6` stay in the left node, while `20` stays in the right node.
```
      [10]
     /    \
 [5, 6]  [20]
```

---

#### **Step 5: Insert 12**
- Insert `12` into the right node `[20]`, making it `[12, 20]`.

```
      [10]
     /    \
 [5, 6]  [12, 20]
```

---

#### **Step 6: Insert 30**
- Insert `30` into the right node. The right node `[12, 20]` now has `3` keys, which exceeds the limit, so the node is split. The middle key `20` moves up to the root.

**Before Split**:
```
      [10]
     /    \
 [5, 6]  [12, 20, 30]
```

**After Split**:
```
      [10, 20]
     /    |    \
 [5, 6] [12] [30]
```

---

#### **Step 7: Insert 7**
- Insert `7` into the left node `[5, 6]`, making it `[5, 6, 7]`.
- The node `[5, 6, 7]` now has 3 keys, so it splits. The middle key `6` moves up to the root.

**Before Split**:
```
      [10, 20]
     /    |    \
 [5, 6, 7] [12] [30]
```

**After Split**:
```
      [6, 10, 20]
     /   |   |   \
  [5]  [7] [12] [30]
```

---

#### **Step 8: Insert 17**
- Insert `17` into the middle node `[12]`, making it `[12, 17]`.

```
      [6, 10, 20]
     /   |   |    \
  [5]  [7] [12, 17] [30]
```

---

### Final B-Tree Structure:
```
      [6, 10, 20]
     /   |   |    \
  [5]  [7] [12, 17] [30]
```

### How B-Tree Works:
- **Insertions**: When a node becomes full (contains `m - 1` keys), it splits, and the middle key is moved up.
- **Splitting**: The splitting operation ensures that the tree remains balanced by keeping the height of the tree low.
- **Search**: Searching in a B-Tree is similar to searching in a binary tree but faster due to fewer levels.

### Why Use a B-Tree?
- **Efficient disk access**: B-Trees are optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data, making them efficient for database systems.
- **Balanced**: B-Trees remain balanced, ensuring that operations like search, insertion, and deletion are efficient.
- **Multiple keys per node**: This allows B-Trees to handle large data sets efficiently.
