No worries! You’re asking about **tree traversal** methods: in-order, pre-order, and post-order. These are ways to visit all the nodes in a tree systematically. Here's what each of them does:

### 1. **In-order Traversal (LNR - Left, Node, Right)**:
- In in-order traversal, the left subtree is visited first, then the current node, and finally the right subtree.
- This traversal gives nodes in **ascending order** for a binary search tree (BST).

Steps:
1. Traverse the left subtree.
2. Visit the node.
3. Traverse the right subtree.

Example:
```
      50
     /  \
   30    70
  /  \   /  \
20   40 60  80
```

**In-order traversal**: 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80

---

### 2. **Pre-order Traversal (NLR - Node, Left, Right)**:
- In pre-order traversal, the current node is visited first, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.
- This is useful for creating a copy of the tree.

Steps:
1. Visit the node.
2. Traverse the left subtree.
3. Traverse the right subtree.

Example for the same tree:
**Pre-order traversal**: 50, 30, 20, 40, 70, 60, 80

---

### 3. **Post-order Traversal (LRN - Left, Right, Node)**:
- In post-order traversal, the left subtree is visited first, then the right subtree, and finally the current node.
- This is useful for deleting the tree because you first delete the subtrees before the node itself.

Steps:
1. Traverse the left subtree.
2. Traverse the right subtree.
3. Visit the node.

Example for the same tree:
**Post-order traversal**: 20, 40, 30, 60, 80, 70, 50

---

### Summary of the three traversals:
- **In-order**: Left → Node → Right
- **Pre-order**: Node → Left → Right
- **Post-order**: Left → Right → Node

They all go through the entire tree but in different sequences, depending on when the current node is visited.

Would you like to implement these traversal methods in your Java code?
